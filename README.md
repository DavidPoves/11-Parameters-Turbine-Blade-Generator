# TurbineBladeGenerator
Parametrization of the geometry of a turbine blade given the 11 parameters as explained in: L.J. Pritchard: An eleven parameter axial turbine airfoil geometry model.

After selecting the 11 geometric parameters and the number of points to be used for the discretization of the curves, the user is asked if data should be saved. In case the answer is yes, two .txt files containing the x and y coordinates of the pressure and suction side respectively will be saved on the current working directory. A third .csv file will be saved, which will contain the dependent data (information that derives from the 11 elemental parameters).
